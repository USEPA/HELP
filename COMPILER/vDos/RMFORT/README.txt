RM/FORTRAN
Version 2.40
(C)Copyright Ryan-McFarland Corp 1984, 1987

1)  RM/FORTRAN is now delivered on four 360KB diskettes and two 720KB
    diskettes.

2)  Make sure APPEND does not point to any existing directories containing
    RM/FORTRAN files.

    To disable the APPEND, type 'APPEND=;'

3)  To install RM/FORTRAN, place the UTILITY Distribution diskette
    (COMPILER Distribution diskette if you are using 3 1/2 inch media)
    in a diskette drive and enter:

         n:INSTALL

    where n is the drive letter of the diskette drive.
    Respond to the questions to complete the installation.

    If you are using DOS 2.X, you will need to install RM/FORTRAN
    using one of the following procedures:

    ======================================================
    Installing RM/FORTRAN on a Fixed-Disk System (DOS 2.X)
    ======================================================

    A)  Assuming C is the default drive, insert the UTILITY
        Distribution diskette in drive A.

    B)  Enter the following COPY Command:

              COPY A:*.* /V

    C)  Replace the UTILITY Distribution diskette with the
        COMPILER Distribution diskette and repeat Step B.

    D)  Replace the COMPILER Distribution diskette with your
        chosen Library diskette -- NP_LIB if you have a 80(X)87
        math coprocessor or EM_LIB if you do not. Repeat Step B.

    E)  Refer to "Post Installation Requirements" in the
        RM/FORTRAN INSTALLATION SUPPLEMENT.


    ======================================================
    Installing RM/FORTRAN on a Diskette System (DOS 2.X)
    ======================================================

    A)  Insert your DOS diskette in drive A (the default).

    B)  Insert a scratch diskette in drive B.

    C)  Enter the DOS DISKCOPY Command as follows:

              DISKCOPY A: B:

        When the DISKCOPY Command prompts you to insert your
        source diskette in drive A, do so by replacing the DOS
        diskette in drive A with the UTILITY Distribution
        diskette.

    D)  Replace the newly created diskette in drive B with
        another scratch diskette and enter Y in response to the
        prompt "Copy another diskette (Y/N)?".

    E)  When the DISKCOPY Command prompts you to insert your
        source diskette in drive A, do so by replacing the UTILITY
        Distribution diskette in drive A with the COMPILER
        Distribution diskette.

    F)  Repeat Steps D and E, but replace the source diskette
        in drive A with your chosen Library diskette -- NP_LIB if
        you have a 80(X)87 math coprocessor or EM_LIB if you do not.

    G)  Refer to "Post Installation Requirements" in the
        RM/FORTRAN INSTALLATION SUPPLEMENT.
