Student Tracking and Reporting lets you register students for a
specific course and shows current class availability.  You can
also record student assignment and test scores and keep track of
semester and cumulative grade point averages.  The reports let
you print out a class schedule sorted by department, a roll for
each class, a schedule of classes for each student, and a grade
report for each student.  The database is designed for use with
DataPerfect 2.3.

You may copy and modify this database for your own or your
company's use.  You may not copy the database and resell it. 
Please be aware that while WordPerfect Corporation is happy to
provide support on DataPerfect questions, only limited support is
available for these predefined databases.  No support is
available for the databases if they have been modified.

PANELS
Student Tracking and Reporting (STAR) was created with a built-in
menu to make navigating it easier.  STAR contains 11 panels and
16 menu options.  Most of your work can be done by accessing one
of the menu options.  However, if you need to work directly with
the panel list, you can enter 99 to bypass the menu.

As you tab through each field in a panel, a help message at the
top of the screen explains what to do while in that field.  Press
Help (F3) twice for further information about the field.

REPORTS
Student Tracking and Reporting provides 7 custom reports in
addition to Built-In Short Reports.  Each report is available
from the menu (options 11-15 and 21-22).  Using DPPrint when
running reports is recommended.  For more information about
DPPrint, see Appendix L: Utilities--DPPrint in DataPerfect
Reference.

USING THE DATABASE
Selecting a menu option will access a database panel or will
begin a report.  The menu options for adding, editing, or looking
up are described below.

     Menu option 1 allows you to view or edit information about
     teachers (e.g., their name, address, phone number and
     extension, Social Security Number, and hire date), and gives
     access to their teaching history.

     Menu option 2 allows you to view or edit information about
     students (e.g., their name, address, phone number and
     extension, Social Security Number, and application date),
     and gives access to their transcripts and major.

     Menu option 3 allows you to edit or view class information,
     including department name, class title, teacher, notes about
     the class (requirements, prerequisites, etc.), and the class
     schedule(s), locations, credits, and ID.  The Department,
     Class Title, and Teacher fields allow you to select from a
     lookup list while creating a new record.

     Menu option 4 allows you to enter information about your
     school.  The information you enter here is used in various
     reports.

     Menu option 5 allows you to read notes about the database
     and its intended purpose.

     Menu option 6 allows you to look up or add class names to a
     panel (for inclusion in the class information, available
     from menu option 3).

     Menu option 7 allows you to look up or add department names
     to a panel (for inclusion in the class information,
     available from menu option 3).

     Menu option 8 allows you to add or look up or add majors to
     a panel (for inclusion in the Student Information (Major)
     panel available from the Majors link from option 3).

     Menu option 9 allows you to add or look up class
     assignments.

The menu options for reports are described below.

     Menu option 11 prints a list of teachers by department.

     Menu option 12 prints all report cards by semester.

     Menu option 13 prints a list of classes by department.

     Menu option 14 prints a single student's transcript.  You
     can enter the student's social security number or select the
     student from a lookup.

     Menu option 15 exports a single student's information in
     WordPerfect named merge field format.  You can select the
     student from a lookup.

     Menu options 21 will mark an individual record so you will
     not see it in your normal work.

     Menu option 22 will unmark an individual archived record so
     you can continue to work with it.
