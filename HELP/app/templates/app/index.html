        <h2>Getting started</h2>

            The Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) computer        
            program is a quasi-two-dimensional hydrologic model of water movement
            across, into, through and out of landfills. The model accepts weather, soil
            and design data and uses solution techniques that account for the effects of
            surface storage, snowmelt, runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration,
            vegetative growth, soil moisture storage, lateral subsurface drainage,
            leachate recirculation, unsaturated vertical drainage and leakage through
            soil, geomembrane or composite liners. Landfill systems including various
            combinations of vegetation, cover soils, waste cells, lateral drain layers,
            low permeability barrier soils, and synthetic geomembrane liners may be
            modeled. The program was developed to conduct water balance analysis of
            landfills, cover systems and solid waste disposal and containment
            facilities. As such, the model facilitates rapid estimation of the amounts
            of runoff, evapotranspiration, drainage, leachate collection and liner
            leakage that may be expected to result from the operation of a wide variety
            of landfill designs. The primary purpose of the model is to assist in the
            comparison of design alternatives as judged by their water balances. The
            model, applicable to open, partially closed and fully closed sites, is a
            tool for both designers and permit writers.
