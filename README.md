## Development of an updated Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) Model Software application
HELP v3.07 is a DOS executable program, meaning it does not run in a Windows or iOS environment. The 16-bit program will not natively work with 64-bit systems (i.e., most Windows 7 and more recent systems). Therefore, a 3rd party emulator is required. This walkthrough will describe how to use a DOS emulator to install the HELP model. HELP v3.07 will run natively on 32-bit systems, through the Windows Command line. For 32-bit systems, unzip the program and double-click INSTALL.exe, following the walkthrough from Step 7. To check if your PC is 32 or 64-bit, navigate to the Start menu (may be a Windows icon), Click Computer, Click System Properties (or similar). A window with your Windows Edition and System Information will appear. System type will display either 32 or 64-bit Operating System.
